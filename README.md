# all-computer-languages
For my devops career, I educate myself in a large variety of computer languages to do CI/CD and TDD in any required language.
Since the cross-section is taken across languages, the tests for a particular language may be simple. Test snapshots show what language syntax is tested.
Some tests are taken from https://www.w3schools.com; others from LinkedIn and similar sources.

# all-computer-languages
This is an ambitious project to get educated in a large variety of computer languages. 
Since the cross-section is taken across languages, the tests for a particular language are
not so deep; only basic fluence is required. Test snapshots show what language syntax is tested.
The tests are taken from https://www.w3schools.com
